Frequently Asked Questions
====================

Do you have examples of SAS apps built with the SASjs framework?
---------------------
We have a list of public SAS apps in github repositories available [here](https://sasjs.io/apps/) - using these you can see examples of the configuration used to build SASjs apps.
There is also a commercial app built with the framework that has been deployed to customers in several countries - it's called [Data Controller for SAS](https://datacontroller.io)


What are the Minimum Requirements for building Apps on SAS?
---------------------

To build apps on SAS you need SAS Viya 3.4 and above, or SAS 9.3 and above with Stored Process Server.

**You cannot create web apps on SAS with University Edition.**

To check if you have SAS Viya, open SAS Studio, click your user profile and click "About".

If you are using Enterprise Guide, then simply run:

```sas
data _null_;
  length url $128;
  rc=METADATA_GETURI("Stored Process Web App",url);
  putlog 'Your SAS 9 url is: ' url;
run;
```

Which Browsers Does SASjs Support?
---------------------

With the right polyfills your SASjs app can support a very wide range of browsers, however the question is - do you really want to?  There can be a lot of edge cases to cover and support.

For guidance you might consider following SAS Institute's browser [support policy](https://support.sas.com/en/documentation/third-party-software-reference/9-4/support-for-9-4-web-browsers.html#:~:text=Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer%20and%20Microsoft%20Edge&text=For%20most%20SAS%209.4%20applications,do%20not%20support%20Microsoft%20Edge).  Note the diminishing support for IE.

I want to help, but Iâ€™m not a developer. Are there any ways for non-coders to contribute?
